# frozen_string_literal: true

# This migration creates a new table to track who is visible to patrol officers.
# We are removing the `visible` column from `people` because,
# as a boolean column,
# it does not let us audit when plans were visible vs not.
#
# This migration is forgetful -
# everyone will be transitioned to non-visible.
