  "I was on a police issued mountain bike in a fully authorized bicycle uniform with my partner Officer Johnson (0000). At approximately 1242 hours we were on routine patrol when I witnessed John Smith (W/M 01/01/1985) punch a light pole and proceed to walk into the street.  I contacted Smith and asked him what was wrong. Smith was calm and compliant and told me that he felt like killing himself. Smith said that approximately three days ago he had overdosed on his medication and was admitted to County Hospital in Seattle. Since Smith overdosed on his medication they took it from him and now he hasn't had his prescription meds in five days.  Smith asked if he could go to the hospital. I requested an AMR to transport Smith to County Hospital.  Smith was compliant and calm during our entire contact.  I screened the voluntary committal with A/Sgt Johnson at the precinct.",
  "*****THIS INCIDENT WAS CAPTURED ON ICV. I was on uniform patrol in a fully marked vehicle with my partner Officer Johnson. We responded to a suicidal call. The subject Smith is a chronic caller who is known to both Officer Johnson and me. We contacted Smith who initially disregarded officers and made a show of being angry and punching the walls. Smith was hitting the walls hard enough to make noise, but not hard enough to cause damage. When we did not call for Fire or AMR to report to the scene Smith elevated her behavior and began repeating that he was not safe with himself. He then began to cry. I spoke to staff who stated Smith had been trying to get attention \"all day\" and had tried repeatedly to get staff to give him \"meds\" ahead of schedule. Staff said with all of this Smith had still been happy and laughing. Staff stated this all changed when Smith placed marijuana on the counter. After telling multiple times staff pushed the marijuana off onto the floor. This sent Smith into a fit of rage. He began throwing things at staff and stated he was going to kill himself. Officer Hewitt and I took turns talking to Smith and were able to get him to calm down. We were very frank with him about what we believed would happen if he was sent to the hospital. We also re-enforced her good behaviors. This seemed to calm Smith who agreed that going to the hospital would do him no good because they would most likely discharge him immediately. Smith stated he was having difficulty managing his medications and was hoping to see his case worker in the morning. Smith stated he would go to his room and make every effort to get to his appointment in the morning. Business cards with Officer Johnson and my name, serial number, and the incident number were given to Smith and Supportive Housing staff.",

While on the call I onviewed a disturbance, involving Smith and the MHS staff.   Adams explained that overnight the staff had to bar Smith's fiance from the premises and also took away Smith's guest privleges. Smith became very upset and began yelling profanities at the staff members as well as punching walls. Adams stated that Smith never threatened physical violence against them or assaulted anyone. Staff was concerned that Smith may damage property with because of his behavior, but Smith had not broken anything at that point in time.  When we arrived Smith assumed that the staff had called police because of his behavior. I heard Smith say that he was glad police had arrived in case he did something then he could go to jail. Once officers explained the seriousness of the situation to Smith he calmed down and stated that he would be leaving soon to meet with his payee.  I explained to staff that I would be writing a report and documenting the incident.  Business card and case number provided.",
  "I was working patrol in a marked City of Seattle Police vehicle. I was in full uniform. The patrol vehicle is equipped with a digital in car video system which recorded my involvement. We were dispatched to Mental Health Services.  On arrival I contacted Smith. Smith is well known to officers for his multiple complaints of potential self harm and crisis issues. He also has well documented mental health diagnosis and a crisis plan.  Smith's fiance said that Smith had just taken a handful or her medication. Staff also said that Smith took a three day supply of some of his medications. They said poison control said the medications taken were not enough to overdose, but that he might become lethargic. They said when he began getting a \"a little loopy\" they called 911.  Smith was hard to focus, but he said he only took the medication his sleep and denied doing it for self harm. He had a lot of belongings and his rat with him and he said he was trying to move to suburbs with his fiance. SFD stated that the medication taken was not enough to overdose or would not cause an overdose. Alcohol was also a factor and Smith was alert and oriented, but I do not believe he was an imminent threat to himself.  I provided Smith and his fiance a ride to the ferry dock.",
  "I was uniformed and in a marked patrol car. I have worked in patrol in the for approximately eighteen years, on all watches. On this day I was working solo when I heard dispatch broadcast the call a caller reporting he was suicidal. Smith is a known, there are two hazard flags linked to him within the last year.  Smith also flagged as being mental. I was only a few blocks away. While I was waiting for my back-up I watched Smith walk away from the Supportive Housing facility. A few minutes as my back up was arriving I saw him walk back into the facility. I went in to speak with him and his case manager, Francis Jones.  He told me for about the last year he has been working with Smith on coping skills to help him through times of emotional distress.  Jones said he believed taking Smith to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation would be detrimental, and would only further ingrain the behavior he has been displaying.  Jones also said when Smith is in an attention seeking behavior mode and receives what he wants it only exacerbates his mental illness.   He convinced him to take a walk with him to talk out options other than calling 911 after he wants to kill himself. Jones and Smith walked off together, I left the immediate area to write my report. I asked dispatch to let me know if 911 center received more calls involving Smith.",
  "I am familiar which Smith from a few previous encounters.  He lives in Seattle and gets his medication at the Mental Health Services. Today he was very depressed, reporting it the anniversary of he sister's death. He told me County Hospital had seen him as recently as yesterday; none of the DMHPs who evaluated him believed inpatient treatment was appropiate. I spoke with his case worker of almost a year, Francis Jones.  He told me there is a plan in place for Smith; she is choosing not to follow through with coping mechanisms they have set up for her.  Jones suggestion was to have Smith walk outside with him to help him calm down and lift his mood. He agreed, they left the Supportive Housing facility together. SFD was the first to evaluate Smith for this specic 911 call he placed saying he wanted to die.  On of the medics imformed me his concern was, there was chance of a interstinal puncture. Smith declined medical assistance.",

  "On 6-9-16 I was dispatched to the alley behind Smith's address due to a neighbor's complaint that a woman was banging on trash cans.  The call was an hour old when I was dispatched.  Radio advised that they had recieved multiple calls from the woman banging on the trash cans, later identified as Smith.  Third watch had responded several times due to crisis disturbances in reference to Smith.  Radio advised that someone had broken a window at the nearby Fire Station, and also that Smith reported having a cut on her hand.  Third watch advised that there was no P/C for Smith's arrest.  When I arrived, there was no one in the alley causing a disturbance.  I sent an email to CRT requesting his unit follow-up with Smith due to the fact that she has been contacted by police multiple times over the past few weeks.  Just after sending the email, Smith called 911 and said she needed police.  I responded to her address and knocked on her window (it is not possible to get to her front door due to locked gates).  Smith looked at me out the window, showed me a small cut on her right hand, and said she wanted me to 'note' that it was there.  Then she yelled obsenities at me and said she didn't want to have anything to do with police.  Then she opened another window, spoke/grunted in a language other than English, and threw several items on the ground.  She continued to yell obsenities at me and repeated that she didn't want police assistance.  A short time later offices responded to the overpass due to a 911 complaint of a female, that matched Smith's description, who was in the street and appeared high.  I located Smith a couple blocks away.  She yelled obsenities again and walked away.  The complainant didn't want contact, and I was not able to determine for sure if Smith was the person who had been in the road.  When I saw her she was very angry and agitated, but she was on the sidewalk.  She walked home saying she was going to feed her cats.  Most of what she said didn't make sense, and at times it seemed as if she were talking to people that weren't there.  Smith said she has multiple personalities.  Today she seemed to be alternating beween 'Ashley' and 'Amanda'.  I screened the arrest, and Smith was transported to the Jail.  I requested mental health court.  I sent another email to CRU informing them of Smith's arrest.",
  "Smith called 911 and requested that the Fire Department and Police Department respond to her address.  Smith told dispatch that she committed a crime and wanted to go to jail.  Also, that she was having medical problems as well as mental problems.  I have contacted Smith several times in the past in relation to crisis issues, and I am familiar with her situation.  Smith changes identity (according to his case manager).  This morning Smith identified at the 'Ashley''.  I arrived, along with other officers, and contacted the Fire Department who had already talked to Smith.  They said she didn't need medical attention, but that she wanted to be arrested.  I asked Smith why he wanted to be arrested.  She said she needed to go to jail because she stole a skate board some time over the past two months.  I told Smith that I could write a report, but I would not be able to book her into jail.  Smith said that going to the hospital would be a good second option, but she didn't want to go via AMR due to the cost.  Smith wanted to go to the hospital partly because she lost some of her prescription medications.  She was lucid this morning, and I didn't see any reason to send Smith to the hospital involuntarily.  I asked Smith if she would be willing to talk to the Mobile Crisis Team, and she said she was.  I called the MCT, and they responded.  They were able to take Smith to the hospital.  Before leaving, Smith thanked me for not booking her into jail.",
  "Smith (who sometimes goes by Amanda) called to report a theft.  I am familiar with Smith due to multiple contacts in relation to crisis behavior.  Today Smith reported that she was at the skate park the other day hanging out with some neighbor kids.  She thinks one of the kids took her keys.  Smith said the kid lives in an apartment nearby. Smith tried to talk to the kid's sisters about the keys, but hasn't been able to get them back yet.  Smith said she didn't want the police to make a big deal out of the incident, she just wanted it reported.  Smith did exhibit some behavior today consistent with her crisis tendencies.  Smith had trouble staying on track with the story she was telling, and appeared to have some trouble organizing her thoughts.  Overall, she was calm today and no police action was necessary in relation to crisis behavior.  I provided her with a card and case number for the theft.  Note:  The missing keys include a bike lock key and a mail key.",
  "I saw Smith in the middle of the street, walking near the center line.  I have contacted Smith several times in the past due to crisis issues, and I recognized her. Smith was blocking traffic (myself and a garbage truck).  She was wearing a bath robe and underwear.  When she saw me, she turned toward my patrol car, opened her robe, and exposed herself from the waist up.  I activated my emergency flashers, and Smith walked away from me.  I tried to talk to her, but she just yelled expletives at me and continued to walk away.  I requested a CRT unit to respond, but none were available at this hour (I am CIT).  While I was waiting for other units to arrive, Smith made it back to her apartment complex.  This is a square shaped apartment complex with a gated court yard in the center.  Smith came out onto the sidewalk and threw a glass container across the street.  When other officers arrived I tried to talk to her over the gate.  She wouldn't answer questions, but she did throw several items over the gate in our direction (a walker and a another glass container; she also threw a vacuum cleaner over the opposite gate).  At one point Smith went inside her apartment and opened a window to yell at us.  I requested that she come outside to talk to us, but she refused.  Smith continued to yell expletives at us, and at one point she said, in English, that she didn't speak our language.  After Smith went inside her apartment we were able to gain access to the court yard.  Smith turned out all the lights in her apartment, and several minutes went by without any noise or contact.    At that point we didn't have cause to enter her apartment without permission, and it was clear she wasn't coming out.  I had the other officers move their patrol cars so that it would appear as if we left the area.  I waited inside the court yard with other officers to see if Smith would come out and cause a disturbance if she thought we left.  Her apartment remained dark, and we didn't hear any noise.  I decided it was best to leave with the hope that she would get some sleep.",
  "I was working the marked patrol unit in Seattle.  I responded to a person in crisis.  Radio reported that the complainant would be waiting out front of the listed address and that they want police to call the mobile crisis team.  I arrived to the listed location with my partner.  I contacted Smith.  Smith is reporting that she called 911 to get in touch with the mobile Crisis Team.  Smith states that she missed the Hope link bus that would take her home.  Smith reports that she has multiple personality issues and takes medications.   She said that she has no thoughts of harming herself or anyone else tonight.  Her main concern is to get a ride home so she can take care of her pets and have her medications.  She has multiple bags and luggage items with her and is unable to carry everything home.  I called the Mobile Crisis team for Smith and let them know what was going on tonight.  They said they would be by to help Smith get home. Smith states that she feels fine waiting by herself until the MCT arrives.  I confirmed that Smith was safe and let her know that if anything changes she can call 911 back.",
  "I was dispatched to check for someone walking in the middle of the street and throwing bricks around. I located the subject. I asked the subject if they were okay and if they needed any assistance. She said something about her cat and something about God. She then climbed up some metal scaffolding located in the park. The scaffolding was approximately 20-25 feet high. It was too dangerous for officers to go up there and attempt to have a dialogue with her. She began to scream about her \"batteries being low and needed lithium to charge them\". She then took off most of her clothes and showed her buttocks to officers. I was able to position my in car camera to get her actions on video. I immediately called for a CIT Unit to respond.   Once she was done screaming on top of the scaffolding she grabbed her sweat pants and climbed down. She wrapped the sweat pants around her head and took off running in the middle of the road. Officers were able to intercept her mid block. Officers were concerned she may get hit by a car. At this time CRT arrived on scene.   She then climbed into some sticker bushes with bare feat. It was obvious the subject was in some sort of crisis and was not able to care for herself. The CRT Officer asked the subject her name. She replied \"Amanda\". MHP knew the subject from previous contacts as Smith. A routine records check showed the subject was assaultive towards officers and needs mental health care. CRT Officer explained to Smith that we were detaining her for her own safety. Smith then stated we were making her feel \"purple\". Smith did have an injury on her face, her cheek and eye were all swollen. When asked about it and said she was punched in the face by a black guy who lives in a nearby apartment building. She said she called 911 last night but I am unable to find any record of it. She then began to make animal noises.   Due to the fact that Smith was running in the road, was climbing scaffolding and taking her clothes off, was saying things that did not make sense and had an injury on her face that most likely needed some medical attention officers felt she needed to go to the hospital. AMR responded to the scene. Smith was transported to hospital for an involuntary commitment. MHP was able to get me Smith's case manager's information. Her case manager is Francis Jones at Mental Health Services. Smith was sent to the hospital at the same location for running into traffic.",
